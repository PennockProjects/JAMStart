# About

I'm a software engineer currently incubating AI, Elder Tech, and Nuxt front ends. I'm originally from Idaho Falls, Idaho and currently work in the Seattle area, Washington in the United States. My career has encompassed software engineering, program management, and startup founder for Microsoft, startup ArcZap, and Wizards of the Coast. In various roles I have designed and engineered software at many levels of the services, backend servers, front end web, applications, and games stack. I love gaming üêâ, personal finance üí∏ and history üèõÔ∏è.

## Incubation Projects

My current incubation projects are:

- John Pennock [Portfolio](http://www.pennocks.net) - This site.  My web presence site that blogs about software development. My key learnings from this project are to design, develop, and document a repeatable site framework that uses Nuxt[^1], Markdown, and Static-Site generation for cheap and fast hosting of my own blog.
- Greek and Roman Mythology [Minimyth](http://minimyth.com) - My site about mythology as represented on ancient coins. I'm passionate about the topic, but my key incubation learnings from this project are to explore a collection of Mongo NoSQL documents, with a custom schema and content images and relate them to cloud search.
- Elder Tech - No site yet, but exploring how to leverage AI for senior citizen to provide their medical history, information about recent advances, and drug interactions.
