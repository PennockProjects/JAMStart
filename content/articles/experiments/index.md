## PDF Viewer 
The [DGT SDS home page](/articles/experiments/pdfviewer/dgt) for this experiment

### Notes
- [Clorox SDS](/experiments/dgt/sds/clorox) uses PDF Viewer
  - This should work on Browser, Android, and Apple
- [Sharpie SDS](/experiments/dgt/sds/sharpie) and [WD-40 SDS](/experiments/dgt/sds/wd40) uses Browser Embed PDF Viewer
  - This didn't seem to work on my Android
- [Riviera Apartment](/articles/experiments/pdfviewer/orgs/riviera) has a hard coded QR code
- [MSDS Digital](https://msdsdigital.com/){:target="_blank"} is a general website that provides SDS services for poster printing and e-book binders for a fee.
  - It doesn't use QR Codes
  - It claims you have to have a printed binder per job site per osha
