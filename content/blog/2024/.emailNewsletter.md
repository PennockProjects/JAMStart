## Email
To create emails with my custom blog domain, I followed [Victor Oyedeji YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_ZVsp21Xyg){:target="_blank"} for creating free custom domain accounts at [Zoho Email](https://zoho.com){:target="_blank"}

### Host?
The first issue I encountered following the instructions at Zoho for creating a custom domain record is the concept of 'Host'.  When I used AWS Route 53 to create the record there is no slot for 'host'.

Assuming they are the same, I added the '@' as the Record name and added the value.  But then it didn't verify for 15 minutes (I had set TTL to 5min)

or 24 hours later...

#### Troubleshooting

1. I used the AWS 'Verify Record' on the TXT and it said everything was fine. But Zoho Mail still claimed it couldn't see it.
2. I noticed that the instructions for Zoho Mail Domain verification said I could use blank instead of `@` for the value, so I removed `@` and then it succeeded.

### MX Records

#### No @ use blank
Ran into the same problem here.  Blank


#### Multiple Records
AWS Route53 Hosted zone create record will not let you create multiple MX Records with the same host name.  You get an error message like 'Can't create MX recode with the same name'.  Instead you need to enter all the values into a single MX record like this.

```shell
10 mx.zoho.com
20 mx2.zoho.com
50 mx3.zoho.com
```
