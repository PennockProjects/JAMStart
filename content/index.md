Welcome to my blog!  My name is John Pennock and I created Pennock Projects to:
1) Incubate, learn, and try out new technologies in AI, healthcare data, and backend servers.
2) Develop a Static Site Generated Blog using Nuxt and markdown for content
3) Publish code, learnings, tips, and examples

I am solely responsible for the content here. Nothing published here should be understood as being representative of any other person, organization, or association.

Thanks for looking around. Read more [about me](/about), my [code examples](/examples), my [projects](/projects), or the latest on my [blog](/blog)
