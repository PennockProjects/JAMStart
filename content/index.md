Welcome. My name is John Pennock.  This is a blog about:
1) My engineering journey with new technology stacks
2) How to create a base Static Site Generated framework site with Nuxt
3) Documenting code, learnings, tips, and examples

I am solely responsible for the content here. Nothing published here should be understood as being representative of any other person, organization, or association.

Thanks for looking around.
